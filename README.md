# Financial-Bot-using-LLM

This is a Chatbot model for Financial Analysis. This perosnalised model uses LLM to analyse, pick out specific details and even generate answers for queries. The user simply needs to feed the personalised model with multiple required URL links for references be it news articles, comapany's webpages, text files, etc. and then ask the question. The user doesn't need to research and read all the news articles or webpages by himself and then provide those details to ChatGPT for analysis. This save a lot of time and effort, increasing the efficiency by 5 folds.
